In this project, We are going to look at the tiny version of some of very useful electronic components. The Modules from TinyCircuits are the smaller version of normally available bigger sized modueles. The Modules are miniaturized to a size of your fingertip making it easier to build small sized projects. Some of you might be thinking that soldering them will be a lot more difficult but don't worry, The modules has connectors of their own and do need to be soldered which makes it more advantageous to use these.

We are not just having a look at these modules but we are also going to use them in Building a fitness Tracker of our own. The fitness tracker will use the Tiny Screen+, Accelerometer Sensor Wireling, Pulse Oximeter Wireling, LRA Motor Driver Wireling all of them in their tiny state. The Tiny Screen+ has a Flappy Birds mode preloaded that needs to be configured before using in our project and after that we just need to upload the code and we are ready to go. The TinyScreen+ will act as the heart of the project performing the task that an Arduino or ESP8266 performs in the bigger version.
